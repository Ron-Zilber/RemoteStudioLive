                Echo server instructions:
 
 Use those instructions to run the echo server on a server machine
 and echo messages that are sent from a client machine


 1. On the server machine use the Bash command "ifconfig" to find the IP address of the machine.
 2. copy that address to the ServerIP constant variable on the client.go code on the client machine
 3. On the server machine run main.go
 4. On the client machine run client.go

(*) The way that works is when the server is the lab machine and the client is the laptop

At this point, a message from the client should arrive at the server, and echoed back the the client.
(The other way is not working)
